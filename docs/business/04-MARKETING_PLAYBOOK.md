# Rentify — Marketing Playbook

> Practical, budget-conscious marketing tactics for a first-time founder building a two-sided marketplace.

---

## Marketing Budget Rules

**Phase 1 (Pre-Revenue): $500/month max**

- 80% → paid search (Google Ads)
- 20% → tools (Canva Pro, email platform)

**Phase 2 (Early Revenue): $2,000/month**

- 40% → paid search
- 20% → social ads
- 20% → content creation
- 20% → referral incentives

**Phase 3 (Scaling): 15–20% of revenue**

- Diversified across all channels

**Golden rule**: Never spend on demand until you have supply density. Marketing a marketplace with no listings is burning money.

## Channel 1: Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

### Google Ads Setup

**Campaign structure:**

```
Account
├── Campaign: Items Rental [City]
│   ├── Ad Group: Camera Rental
│   │   └── Keywords: "rent camera [city]", "camera rental near me", "DSLR rental"
│   ├── Ad Group: Tool Rental
│   │   └── Keywords: "rent power tools [city]", "drill rental near me"
│   └── Ad Group: General Rental
│       └── Keywords: "rent stuff near me", "peer to peer rental"
├── Campaign: Services [City]
│   ├── Ad Group: Photography Services
│   └── Ad Group: Moving Services
└── Campaign: Brand
    └── Keywords: "rentify", "rentify app"
```

**Budget allocation:**

- Start with $15/day on the highest-intent campaign
- Measure cost-per-booking (not just cost-per-click)
- Kill any keyword with CPA > $20 after 100 impressions

**Ad copy formula:**

```
Headline 1: Rent a [Item] in [City]
Headline 2: From $[price]/day • Verified Owners
Headline 3: Insured & Protected
Description: Browse [X]+ items near you. Book in minutes. Free cancellation.
```

### SEO Strategy

**Target keywords (build content around these):**

| Keyword Pattern                          | Monthly Volume | Difficulty | Content Type         |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| "rent [item] near me"                    | 500-5K         | Low        | Landing page         |
| "[item] rental [city]"                   | 200-2K         | Low-Med    | Category page + blog |
| "how much does it cost to rent a [item]" | 100-1K         | Low        | Blog / pricing guide |
| "[item] rental vs buying"                | 100-500        | Low        | Blog / comparison    |
| "best [items] for [use case]"            | 1K-10K         | Med        | Blog / buying guide  |
| "how to rent out your [item]"            | 100-1K         | Low        | Blog / supply-side   |

**Content calendar (Phase 2):**

- 2 blog posts per week (SEO-optimized, 1500+ words)
- 1 city-specific landing page per new market
- 1 "rental guide" per new category launch

---

## Channel 2: Social Media

### Instagram Strategy

**Account setup:**

- Professional account (for insights)
- Bio: "Rent anything. From anyone. Near you. 📍[City]"
- Link: Smart link (Linktree or similar) → App Store + Featured Listings

**Content pillars (3-4 posts/week):**

| Day | Content Type           | Example                                              |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Mon | What's available       | Carousel: "5 cameras you can rent this week"         |
| Wed | Success story          | "Meet Alex — he earns $400/month renting his drone"  |
| Fri | Rental tip / education | "3 things to check before you rent a lens"           |
| Sun | Community / UGC        | Repost of a renter's photo/project using rented gear |

**Instagram Stories (daily):**

- "New listing" alerts
- Behind-the-scenes of the startup
- Polls: "Would you rent this for $X/day?"
- Quick tutorials: "How to list an item in 60 seconds"

**Hashtag strategy:**

- Brand: #Rentify #RentDontBuy #RentifyIt

| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Comparison      | Split-screen | "Buy for $3,000 vs rent for $50/day"                   |
| Unboxing        | POV          | "Renting a RED camera for $100"                        |
| Day-in-the-life | Vlog         | "I rented a van and moved my entire apartment for $80" |

## Channel 3: Community Marketing

### Where Your Users Already Are

| Platform                                       | Tactic                                                                  | Effort              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |

**Critical rule:** Never be spammy. Provide value first. Mention Rentify only when it genuinely solves the problem being discussed.

## Channel 4: Referral Program

### Design

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Give $10, Get $10                                    │
│                                                       │
│  Share your unique link with friends.                │
│  When they complete their first rental:              │
│  • They get $10 off                                  │
│  • You get $10 credit                                │
│                                                       │
│  [Copy Link]  [Share via WhatsApp]  [Share via SMS]  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Referral Economics

| Metric                         | Target                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Referral sign-up rate          | 15% of invited                       |
| Referral-to-booking conversion | 30% within 30 days                   |
| Cost per referred user         | $10 (credit, not cash)               |
| Payback period                 | 1.2 bookings                         |
| Viral coefficient target       | 0.3 (each user brings 0.3 new users) |

### Launch timing

- Do NOT launch referral program at Day 1 — nobody refers a product they've used once
- Launch after a user completes their 2nd booking (proven value)
- Prompt: "Loved your rental? Share Rentify with a friend — you both get $10"

---

## Channel 5: Email Marketing

### Automated Sequences

| Trigger                               | Email                                            | Timing               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Signup (no booking)                   | "Welcome! Here's what's near you"                | Day 0                |
| Signup (no booking)                   | "Top rentals in [city] this week"                | Day 3                |
| Signup (no booking)                   | "Your $10 first-rental credit expires in 7 days" | Day 7                |
| First booking completed               | "How was your rental? Leave a review"            | Day 0 (after return) |
| First booking completed               | "Liked renting? List your own items and earn"    | Day 3                |
| Inactive 30 days                      | "We miss you — here's what's new"                | Day 30               |
| Owner (listing not rented in 14 days) | "Tips to make your listing stand out"            | Day 14               |

### Newsletter (Weekly, Phase 2+)

Subject line formula: "[City]: What's rentable this week"

Content:

- 3–5 highlighted listings (rotated to give all owners visibility)
- 1 success story or tip
- 1 seasonal prompt ("Weekend camping? Rent gear instead of buying")

Subject: [City] founder builds "Airbnb for everything" — already [X] bookings

Hi [Name],

I'm [Founder Name], and I've built Rentify — a marketplace where people rent
items and services from each other.

The idea started when I needed a [specific item] for [specific use case] and
realized it costs $[amount] to buy something I'd use once.

In [X months], we've had [X bookings] with [X listings] in [City]. Our users
are [compelling stat — e.g., "saving an average of $200 per rental"].

Would you be interested in learning more? Happy to share data, user stories,
or do a demo.

Best,

### Attribution Rules

- Use UTM parameters on every link (every ad, every email, every social post)
- Track first-touch AND last-touch attribution
- Accept that attribution will be imperfect — that's okay
- When in doubt, ask new users "How did you hear about us?" during onboarding
