## Rentify's Differentiation Summary

### 1. Unified marketplace (items + services)

No competitor offers both in one premium experience. This creates **cross-selling and discovery advantages**: "I rented a camera — oh, I can also hire a photographer."

### 2. Trust-first, premium experience

Most competitors look utilitarian or dated. Rentify's design should feel like **booking a hotel on Mr & Mrs Smith**, not browsing Craigslist.

### 3. Transparent, transaction-based pricing

Unlike Thumbtack/TaskRabbit's lead-based models (which frustrate service providers), Rentify charges a percentage of completed transactions. Fairer for everyone.

### 4. Owner and renter symmetry

Most marketplaces optimize for one side. Rentify treats both sides as first-class users — both get verification, reviews, and trust indicators.
