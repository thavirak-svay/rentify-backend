# Rentify — Go-to-Market Strategy

> How we go from zero to a thriving marketplace, step by step.

---

## Guiding Principle: Solve Supply First

Every marketplace dies without supply. Renters will not come to an empty platform. **We must obsessively build supply before we spend a dollar on demand acquisition.**

The formula:

```
Dense supply in one category + one geography → high conversion → organic demand → expand
```

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1–3)

### Goal: 100 active listings, 50 completed bookings in ONE city

### Choose the Beachhead

**Selection criteria for first category:**

| Criteria                 | Why                                  | Recommended                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| High average order value | Revenue per transaction covers costs | ✅ Camera/AV gear ($50-150/day)    |
| Passionate community     | Organic word-of-mouth                | ✅ Photographers, filmmakers       |
| Low risk of damage       | Fewer disputes early on              | ✅ Electronics (handled carefully) |
| Clear use cases          | Easy to market                       | ✅ "Rent a lens for the weekend"   |
| Seasonal demand spikes   | Predictable growth moments           | ✅ Wedding season, graduation      |

**Selection criteria for first city:**

| Criteria                     | Why                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Dense population             | More potential renters + owners per km²            |
| College town or creative hub | Early adopters, price-sensitive, gear-heavy        |
| You live there               | You ARE customer support in Phase 1                |
| Existing communities         | Photography meetups, maker spaces, Facebook groups |

### Supply Seeding Playbook

**Week 1–2: Personal outreach (target: 20 listings)**

- Post in 5 local Facebook groups for photographers / filmmakers
- Attend 2 photography meetups — demo the app, sign people up on the spot
- Message 20 people on local buy/sell groups who are selling gear: "Would you consider renting it instead?"
- Reach out to 5 small camera rental shops — offer them a free storefront on the platform

**Week 3–4: Incentivize early supply (target: 50 listings)**

- **0% commission** for the first 3 months (announce it loudly)
- **Free professional listing photos**: You photograph their gear (costs you nothing but time, makes the platform look premium)
- **Guaranteed first rental**: If their item doesn't rent in 30 days, you personally rent it for a fair price and create a review

**Week 5–8: Grow to 100 listings**

- Launch a **"List & Earn" referral**: Existing listers get $20 credit for each new lister they refer
- Partner with a local photography school or workshop: "Your students can rent the gear they need for class"
- Create 3 blog posts targeting SEO: "Best cameras to rent in [city]", "Camera rental vs buying", "How to start a camera rental side hustle"

### Demand Generation (Start Only After 50+ Listings)

**Organic (free):**

- Instagram content: "What you can rent on Rentify this week" — beautiful gear shots
- Partner with 2–3 local micro-influencers (5K–20K followers) — free rental in exchange for a story/post
- Respond to every Reddit / Facebook post asking "where can I rent a camera in [city]?"
- Google My Business listing

**Paid (small budget: $500/month):**

- Google Ads on high-intent keywords:
  - "rent camera [city]" — exact match
  - "camera rental near me"
  - "rent [specific camera model]"
- Facebook/Instagram ads targeting photography interest groups within 25km radius

### Success Metrics for Phase 1

| Metric                                            | Target | Kill Threshold        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Active listings                                   | 100    | <30 at end of Month 3 |
| Completed bookings                                | 50     | <15 at end of Month 3 |
| Search-to-book conversion                         | >5%    | <2%                   |
| Average order value                               | >$40   | <$20                  |
| Owner retention (listing still active at 90 days) | >60%   | <30%                  |
| NPS (early users)                                 | >40    | <20                   |

## Phase 2: Product-Market Fit (Months 4–8)

### Goal: $10K+ monthly GBV, 30% repeat booking rate

### Category Expansion

Expand one category at a time using the same supply-first playbook:

| Wave | Category                     | Entry Signal                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2    | Power tools & home equipment | Organic demand: people searching for non-camera items    |
| 3    | Outdoor & sports gear        | Seasonal trigger: summer/ski season approaching          |
| 4    | Party & event supplies       | Partnership trigger: event planner asks "do you have X?" |
| 5    | Services (photography first) | Natural extension: camera owners ARE photographers       |

**Expansion rule**: Don't launch a new category until you have ≥20 committed listers ready to publish on Day 1.

### Product Improvements Based on Phase 1 Data

| Learning                              | Likely Product Response                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Most bookings happen on mobile        | Invest in mobile app polish                |
| Renters want reassurance about damage | Build clearer protection plan flow         |
| Owners worry about no-shows           | Add deposit hold + cancellation penalties  |
| Location matching is clunky           | Improve geo-search and map view            |
| Onboarding is too long                | Reduce steps, allow browsing before signup |

### Marketing Scale-Up

- **SEO content machine**: 2 articles/week targeting "[item] rental [city]" keywords
- **User-generated content**: Prompt renters to share photos of what they rented + made
- **Referral program launch**: $10 for referrer + referee on first completed booking
- **Local press**: Pitch to city lifestyle publications — "This app lets you rent anything from your neighbors"
- **Email marketing**: Weekly "What's new near you" digest for active users

### Fundraising

- Start preparing **seed deck** at Month 4
- Target close by Month 6–7
- Key proof points needed:
  - Repeat booking rate >25%
  - Month-over-month GBV growth >20%
  - Clear unit economics (show that each booking is marginally profitable)
  - Supply retention metrics
  - 3–5 strong user testimonials

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 9–18)

### Goal: 3–5 cities, $100K+ monthly GBV, launch services vertical

### City Expansion Framework

**Do NOT launch a new city without:**

| Pre-requisite                          | Minimum                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Waitlist signups from that city        | 200+                            |
| Committed local seed listers           | 20+                             |
| Local community partner                | 1+ (meetup, co-working, school) |
| City launcher (employee or contractor) | 1 dedicated person              |

**City launch sprint (6 weeks):**

1. **Week 1–2**: Recruit 20 seed listers, photograph their items, publish listings
2. **Week 3**: Activate Google Ads for the city, launch Instagram geo-targeted content
3. **Week 4**: First bookings (subsidize if necessary — $10 off first rental)
4. **Week 5–6**: Monitor conversion, gather feedback, iterate

### Services Vertical Launch

Services are different from items:

- **No physical handoff** — scheduling replaces pickup/delivery
- **Pricing is less standardized** — packages vs. hourly rates
- **Trust is even more critical** — you're inviting a stranger to your home
- **Portfolio matters** — past work is the #1 trust signal

**Launch plan for services:**

1. Start with service providers who are already item owners (camera owners who are photographers)
2. Add "Also available as a service" upsell on item listing pages
3. Require portfolio or past work gallery for service listings
4. Charge slightly higher take rate for services (20%) due to higher AOV and longer decision cycles

## Decision Making: What NOT to Do

| Temptation                        | Why It's Wrong                                       | Do This Instead                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Launch in 5 cities at once        | Thin supply everywhere = bad UX everywhere           | Win one city completely                       |
| Build all features before launch  | Perfect is the enemy of shipped                      | Launch with core booking flow only            |
| Compete on price (race to bottom) | Destroys unit economics, attracts low-quality supply | Compete on trust and experience               |
| Target everyone                   | Generic marketing converts nobody                    | Target passionate communities first           |
| Spend on brand advertising        | Too early, no ROI tracking                           | Spend on high-intent search ads only          |
| Ignore supply quality             | Bad listings = bad reputation = dead marketplace     | Curate aggressively, coach struggling listers |
| Scale support team too early      | Hire when there's consistent 20+ tickets/day         | Founder does support in Phase 1               |
