## Funding Strategy

### Fundraising Milestones

| Round        | Raise       | Valuation | Purpose                                                    | Milestones to Demonstrate                  |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Pre-seed** | $150K–$300K | $1.5M–$3M | Build MVP, validate demand in one city/category            | Working product, 100 listings, 50 bookings |
| **Seed**     | $1M–$2M     | $8M–$12M  | Product-market fit, 2–3 cities, hire core team             | $50K MRR, 30% repeat rate, <20% churn      |
| **Series A** | $5M–$10M    | $40M–$60M | Scale to 10+ cities, launch services vertical, build brand | $500K MRR, unit economics proven, 100K MAU |

### Pre-Seed Sources

| Source                  | Typical Amount  | Considerations                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Personal savings        | $10K–$50K       | Demonstrates founder commitment                                |
| Friends & family        | $25K–$100K      | Keep it clean: SAFE notes, not handshake deals                 |
| Angel investors         | $25K–$100K each | 2–5 angels ideally; look for marketplace / consumer experience |
| Pre-seed funds          | $100K–$300K     | Y Combinator, Techstars, Antler, or regional pre-seed funds    |
| Revenue (bootstrapping) | Variable        | Possible but slow for a marketplace (need both sides)          |

### SAFE Note Terms (Pre-Seed)

```
Instrument:        SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
Valuation cap:     $2M–$3M (negotiate based on traction)
Discount:          20% (standard)
Pro-rata rights:   Yes (for lead investor)
MFN clause:        Yes (most favored nation — if you issue a lower cap later, early investors get it too)
```

### Investor Narrative

**The Pitch (30-second version):**

> $10T+ in consumer assets sit idle 95% of the time. Rentify makes them productive — and makes local services accessible, trusted, and instant. We're the Airbnb for everything else.

**The Pitch (3-minute version):**

```
1. PROBLEM (30s)
   Consumers own expensive things they rarely use.
   When they need something they don't own, their options are bad:
   buy new (wasteful), borrow (awkward), or traditional rental (impersonal, expensive).

2. SOLUTION (30s)
   Rentify is a marketplace where anyone can rent items or services
   from people nearby. We handle trust (identity verification), payments
   (escrow), and protection (insurance).

3. MARKET (30s)
   $10T in idle consumer assets. P2P rental is a $10B+ market growing 20% YoY.
   Tailwinds: sustainability, inflation, access-over-ownership, gig economy.

4. TRACTION (30s)
   [Current numbers: listings, bookings, GBV, repeat rate, NPS]
   [Key insight from user research that validates demand]

5. BUSINESS MODEL (30s)
   15–23% blended take rate. Protection plans (5–10% of rental).
   Promoted listings. Future subscriptions.
   Path to $50K MRR within 12 months.

6. ASK (30s)
   Raising $[X] on a $[Y] cap to [specific milestones].
   This gets us to [Series A readiness metrics].
```

## Financial Model

### Month-by-Month P&L (First 18 Months)

| Month | GBV      | Bookings | Net Revenue | Burn  | Runway Impact                 |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ----------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | $0       | 0        | $0          | -$8K  | Building MVP                  |
| 2     | $0       | 0        | $0          | -$8K  | Building MVP                  |
| 3     | $500     | 10       | $90         | -$8K  | Soft launch                   |
| 4     | $1,500   | 30       | $270        | -$9K  | First real bookings           |
| 5     | $4,000   | 70       | $720        | -$10K | Category seeded               |
| 6     | $8,000   | 130      | $1,440      | -$11K | Liquidity building            |
| 7     | $12,000  | 200      | $2,160      | -$12K | Category 2 launch             |
| 8     | $18,000  | 280      | $3,240      | -$14K | Growing steadily              |
| 9     | $25,000  | 380      | $4,500      | -$16K | Referral program launch       |

| 11    | $50,000  | 650      | $9,000      | -$22K | Hiring begins                 |
| 12    | $70,000  | 850      | $12,600     | -$28K | **$50K MRR target proximity** |
| 13    | $90,000  | 1,100    | $16,200     | -$35K | City 2 launch                 |
| 14    | $120,000 | 1,400    | $21,600     | -$40K | Team scaling                  |
| 15    | $160,000 | 1,800    | $28,800     | -$45K | Protection plans v2           |
| 16    | $210,000 | 2,300    | $37,800     | -$48K | Promoted listings launch      |
| 17    | $270,000 | 3,000    | $48,600     | -$50K | Approaching break-even        |
| 18    | $325,000 | 3,800    | $58,500     | -$50K | **Seed milestone hit**        |

**Key assumptions:**

- Average order value grows from $45 → $65 as higher-value categories are added
- Blended take rate: 18% declining to 17% as volume discounts kick in
- Monthly burn increases as team grows post-seed raise
- Months 1–6: founder only. Month 7: first hire. Month 11: expand team.

### Unit Economics (Target State)

| Metric                          | Formula                                                              | Target              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | Total acquisition spend / new booking users                          | <$25                |
| Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)   | Avg bookings/yr × AOV × take rate × avg lifetime                     | >$75 (LTV:CAC >3:1) |
| Gross margin per transaction    | (Net revenue − payment processing − insurance reserve) / Net revenue | >60%                |
| Contribution margin             | Gross margin − variable support cost per transaction                 | >50%                |
| Payback period                  | CAC / (monthly revenue per user)                                     | <6 months           |

### Break-Even Analysis

```
Fixed costs (monthly):     ~$50,000 (team, infra, legal)
Variable costs per booking: ~$3.50 (2.9% Stripe + $0.30 + insurance reserve)
Revenue per booking:        ~$11.70 (at $65 AOV × 18% take rate)
Contribution per booking:   ~$8.20

Break-even point:           $50,000 / $8.20 = ~6,100 bookings/month
At $65 AOV, that's:         ~$400K GBV/month
```

## Cost Structure (Post-Seed)

### Personnel Plan

| Role                        | Timing   | Monthly Cost         | Rationale                  |
| --------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Founder/CEO                 | Day 1    | $0 (deferred salary) | Until revenue justifies it |
| Backend Engineer #1         | Month 7  | $12,000              | Core platform development  |
| Frontend/Mobile Engineer #1 | Month 8  | $13,000              | App development            |
| Product Designer            | Month 9  | $10,000              | Design system + flows      |
| Backend Engineer #2         | Month 11 | $12,000              | Scale and features         |
| Community/Ops Manager       | Month 11 | $6,000               | Supply seeding + support   |
| Marketing hire              | Month 13 | $8,000               | Growth channels            |
| Frontend/Mobile Engineer #2 | Month 14 | $13,000              | Second platform            |

**Hiring philosophy:**

- Each hire must be justified by a **specific bottleneck** it unblocks
- Prefer contractors/freelancers for the first 6 months (flexibility + lower commitment)
- First engineering hire should be a generalist who can own the entire stack
- Delay marketing hire until there's a channel that's working organically

### Non-Personnel Costs

| Category             | Monthly Budget                   | Notes                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Cloud infrastructure | $80 (Phase 1) → $3,000 (Phase 2) | Start with a $20 VPS, scale with demand |
| SaaS tools           | $200 → $1,000                    | Analytics, support tools, design tools  |
| Marketing spend      | $500 → $15,000                   | Grow with proven channels only          |
| Payment processing   | 2.9% + $0.30 per txn             | Stripe; unavoidable                     |
| Insurance reserve    | ~1% of GBV                       | Protection plan claim reserve           |
| Legal                | $500 → $3,000                    | Quarterly counsel review, TOS updates   |
| Accounting           | $200 → $500                      | Bookkeeping, tax prep                   |

## Financial Controls

### Cash Management Rules

1. **Maintain ≥6 months runway at all times.** If runway drops below 6 months → immediately cut non-essential spend and begin next fundraise.
2. **Never spend >30% of monthly budget on marketing** until unit economics are proven (LTV:CAC >3:1).
3. **Founder salary**: $0 until pre-seed raised. Then $3,000/month max. Increase only after seed closes.
4. **Separate accounts**: Operating account + marketing account + reserve account (3 months minimum expenses).
5. **Monthly financial review**: P&L, cash flow, runway recalculation, budget vs. actual.

### Budget Approval Thresholds

| Spend Amount   | Approval Needed                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| <$500          | Founder discretion                      |
| $500–$2,000    | Documented justification (expected ROI) |
| $2,000–$10,000 | Board/advisor review                    |
| >$10,000       | Board approval                          |

### Financial Reporting

| Report                   | Frequency               | Audience           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Cash position + runway   | Weekly                  | Founder            |
| P&L (actual vs. budget)  | Monthly                 | Founder, advisors  |
| Unit economics dashboard | Monthly                 | Founder, investors |
| Burn rate trend          | Monthly                 | Founder            |
| Investor update email    | Monthly (after raising) | Investors          |

## Cap Table Management

### Pre-Seed Cap Table (Example)

| Stakeholder                | Shares / SAFE           | Ownership (Pre-Dilution) |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Founder                    | 8,000,000 common shares | 80%                      |
| Co-founder (if applicable) | 2,000,000 common shares | 20%                      |
| ESOP (reserved)            | 1,000,000 options       | ~9% (post-ESOP)          |
| Pre-seed investors (SAFE)  | N/A until conversion    | Depends on valuation cap |

**Rules:**

- Set up a standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for all founders
- Reserve 10–15% for ESOP before seed round
- Use Carta or Pulley for cap table management from day 1
- Model dilution through Series A before setting valuation caps

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern                       | Why It's Dangerous                                 | Do This Instead                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Spending before product-market fit | Accelerating a broken engine wastes money          | Prove unit economics, then scale spend                 |
| Raising too much too early         | Excessive dilution, unrealistic expectations       | Raise what you need for 18 months + buffer             |
| Raising too little                 | Running out of money before hitting milestones     | Raise for 18 months of runway minimum                  |
| Ignoring unit economics            | "We'll figure out monetization later" → you won't  | Model unit economics from day 1, even with assumptions |
| Founder taking market salary       | Investors see it as lack of commitment             | $0–$3K until seed, market rate only after Series A     |
| Not tracking burn rate             | "I think we have enough" → you don't               | Weekly cash position check, update runway              |
| Hiding bad news from investors     | Destroys trust; they can't help if they don't know | Monthly updates, even (especially) when struggling     |
