# Rentify — Partnership & Supply Strategy

> How to build and maintain a healthy supply side — the lifeblood of any marketplace.

---

## Supply Is the Moat

In a two-sided marketplace, **supply is harder to build but more durable once built**. An owner who has 50 reviews and $3,000 in lifetime earnings will not switch to a competitor.

**Priority order:**

1. **Density** — Enough listings in a given area so that renters find what they need
2. **Quality** — Listings with good photos, fair prices, accurate descriptions
3. **Diversity** — Multiple categories so the marketplace feels alive
4. **Reliability** — Owners who respond quickly, fulfill bookings, and maintain items

## Supply Acquisition Channels

### Channel 1: Direct Outreach (Phase 1 — Highest ROI)

**Who to target:**
| Target | Where to Find Them | Pitch |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Photography enthusiasts | Camera club meetups, Facebook groups, Reddit r/photography | "Your gear sits in a bag 350 days a year. Put it to work." |
| Tool owners | Neighborhood Facebook groups, Nextdoor | "Your power drill is worth $10/day to someone." |
| Small rental businesses | Google Maps, Yelp, local directories | "Free online storefront. We bring you customers." |
| Gig service providers | TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, Fiverr (look for providers with few reviews = underserved) | "Keep 92% of what you earn. No lead fees." |
| Event equipment owners | Wedding vendor directories, party supply forums | "Wedding season is coming. List your gear now." |

**Outreach script (DM / email):**

```
Hey [Name]!

I'm building Rentify — a local marketplace where people can rent items and
services from neighbors.

I noticed you have [specific item/skill] and thought you might be interested
in listing it. You'd set your own price and availability, and we handle
payments, insurance, and customer support.

Early listers get 0% commission for the first 3 months.

Would you be open to trying it out? I can help you create your listing in
under 5 minutes.

**Partnership pitch template:**

```
Subject: Free resource for your [students/members/clients]

Hi [Name],

I run Rentify — a marketplace where people can rent items and services
locally.

I think your [students/members/clients] could benefit from being able to
rent [specific items] instead of buying them.

Would you be open to us providing [a flyer / a discount code / a short
presentation] for your community? No cost to you — it's a free resource
for your people.

Happy to discuss!

## Supply Onboarding Flow

### Make It Stupid Simple

**Listing creation should take <5 minutes:**

```
Step 1: Take photos (open camera directly — no "upload from gallery" friction)
Step 2: Auto-detect item category (ML-powered, suggest corrections)
Step 3: Title + description (provide AI-generated suggestions based on photos)
Step 4: Set price (show "items like yours rent for $X–$Y/day" benchmark)
Step 5: Set availability (default: always available, adjust as needed)
Step 6: Choose policy (default: Moderate cancellation policy)
Step 7: Publish → "Your listing is live! Here's how to share it."
```

### First-Listing Booster

| Incentive                              | Why                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Free listing photography tips (in-app) | Better photos → more bookings → happier owner |
| "New listing" badge (first 14 days)    | Drives visibility in search results           |
| Owner success email (Day 3)            | "3 tips to get your first booking this week"  |
| Personal check-in (Day 7)              | "How's it going? Need help with anything?"    |

## Supply Quality Framework

### Listing Quality Score (Internal, Not Shown to Owners)

| Factor                            | Weight | Scoring                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Photo count                       | 15%    | ≥5 photos = 100, 3-4 = 70, 1-2 = 40         |
| Photo quality (auto-assessed)     | 15%    | Good lighting + resolution = 100, Poor = 30 |
| Description length + completeness | 15%    | >100 words + all fields filled = 100        |
| Competitive pricing               | 10%    | Within 20% of category median = 100         |
| Response rate                     | 15%    | >90% within 4 hours = 100                   |
| Review score                      | 15%    | ≥4.5 = 100, 4.0 = 80, <3.5 = 30             |
| Cancellation rate                 | 15%    | <5% = 100, 5-15% = 60, >15% = 20            |

### Actions Based on Quality Score

| Score Range | Label             | Action                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 80–100      | Excellent         | Boost in search, eligible for "Featured"                           |
| 60–79       | Good              | Standard visibility                                                |
| 40–59       | Needs improvement | Send coaching tips automatically                                   |
| 20–39       | At risk           | Manual outreach from support                                       |
| 0–19        | Poor              | Suppress from search, notify owner with specific improvement steps |

### Coaching Messages (Automated)

**Low photo quality:**

```
💡 Tip: Listings with 5+ high-quality photos get 3x more bookings.

Try these quick wins:
• Use natural light (near a window works great)
• Show the item from multiple angles
• Include a photo of any accessories
• Add a photo of the item in use

[Update your photos →]
```

**High price vs. category:**

```
💡 Tip: Your [item] is priced at $[X]/day, but similar items in your area
average $[Y]/day.

Consider adjusting your price to increase bookings. You can always raise it
later once you have a few reviews!

[Update your pricing →]

## Supply Retention Strategy

### Why Owners Leave (and How to Prevent It)

| Reason                                     | Prevention                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I never get bookings"                     | Improve listing quality, consider price adjustment coaching             |
| "The process is too complicated"           | Simplify listing management, automate availability                      |
| "I had a bad experience (damage, no-show)" | Fast dispute resolution, effective protection plans, compensation       |
| "I don't want the hassle anymore"          | Reduce friction: auto-accept for repeat renters, recurring availability |
| "I sold the item"                          | Nothing to do — natural churn. Track as a metric.                       |

### Retention Touchpoints

| Timing                    | Action                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1 after listing       | Welcome email + "Share your listing" social tools               |
| Day 7, no booking         | "Tips to get your first booking"                                |
| Day 30, no booking        | Personal outreach: "Can I help?"                                |
| First booking completed   | "Congrats! Your first $X earned" celebration                    |
| Monthly                   | "Your earnings this month: $X" summary                          |
| Quarterly                 | "Your Rentify year: $X earned, X items rented, X happy renters" |
| After negative experience | Proactive check-in within 24 hours                              |
