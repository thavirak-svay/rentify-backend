## Key Assumptions to Validate

> These are the bets we're making. If any are wrong, the business model needs adjustment.

1. **People will rent from strangers** if trust infrastructure is strong enough
2. **Protection plans will achieve 20%+ attach rate** (critical for unit economics)
3. **Average order value will exceed $45** to cover per-transaction costs
4. **Owners will maintain active listings** beyond the first month (supply retention)
5. **One category can seed a marketplace** — we don't need to launch all categories simultaneously
6. **Mobile-first is correct** — our users prefer app over web for this use case
7. **Unified items + services** creates a stronger marketplace than separate verticals
