-- Seed data for development
-- This file is run after migrations during `supabase db reset`

-- Additional test categories (if needed)
-- INSERT INTO categories (name, slug, description, icon, sort_order) VALUES
--   ('Test Category', 'test-category', 'A test category', 'test', 99);

-- Test profiles are auto-created from auth.users, so we don't need to insert them manually
-- Test listings and bookings will be created through the API during testing
